Implementation Details

You will want to persist the accounts and their balances separately from their transactions. Use YML to store the list of accounts. Use a separate CSV file for every account to store their transaction history.

Your implementation must define and make use of the following classes at a minimum:

ATM
Account
Transaction base class that tracks attributes common to all transactions (e.g. date, amount)
Deposit subclass of Transaction used by ATM when recording deposits
Withdrawal subclass of Transaction used by ATM when recording withdrawals

class ATM
 - option to open new Account
   - enter PIN #
   - confirm PIN #
   - if PIN doesnt match, prompt to reenter PIN and confirm
   - after confirmation, specify initial Deposit
   - record initial desposit as Transaction
 - option to go to existing Account
   - specify PIN to access Account
   - specify to see balance
   - balance that correlates with the PIN is displayed
   - If I specify an invalid PIN, I am told that the account was not found
end

class Account
 attributes: PIN, balance
 - report balance
 - make Withdrawal
 - make Desposit
 - Transaction history
end

class Transaction
 attributes: PIN, date, balance, withdrawal amount, desposit amount

 - i must specify PIN to access Account
 - if i specify an invalid PIN, I am told that the account was not found
 - i can specify that i'd like to view my account history
 - all of transactions are displayed in sequential order
 - effective balance should be displayed

end

class Deposit < Transaction
 attributes: PIN, date, balance, desposit amount

 - specify PIN, if not valid, say "Account doesn't exist"
 - specify to make deposit
 - can specify to make a deposit
 - specify the desposit amount
 - if specify a valid deposit amount, Account should be credited the desposit amount, and the Transaction should be recorded
 - My new balance should be displayed

end

class Withdrawal < Transaction
 attributes: date, balance, withdrawal amount

 - specify PIN, if not valid, say "Account doesn't exist"
 - specify to make withdrawal
 - specify withdrawal amount that is less than or eql to balance
 - if withdrawal amount exceeds balance, disallow withdrawal and notify that there's insufficient funds
 - if valid withdrawal amount, withdrawal amount is subtracted from balance and Transaction is recorded
 - new balance should be displayed

end
